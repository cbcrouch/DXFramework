DXFramework
==================================

What is it?
------------

A simple Win32 application for loading SDKmesh and Wavefront obj files and rendering them with DirectX 11.
This project is a hobby project that will be a perpetual WIP as its primary purpose is to expand my knowledge
of the Win32 API and DirectX. Work will be slow going given that I am a family man and have other active
hobby projects as well. Also all development is being done in another revision control system, this repo will
only occasionally be updated with various notable snapshots.

Beware of hardcoded paths and use of tabs.

Dependencies
----------------

Visual Studio 2013
DirectX 11 compatiable GPU and OS

Assets
-------

If you are in need of Wavefront obj files to parse:
- http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml

SDKmesh files can easily be found on the web, typically in most DirectX samples.
